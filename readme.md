## Description
> **VocalMat is an automated tool that identifies and classifies mice vocalizations.**

<p align="justify">
The tool is divided into two main components. The Vocal Identifier, and the Vocal Classifier.

> IMAGE SHOWING VOCALMAT WORKFLOW

<p align="justify">
Vocal Identifier is responsible for identifying possible vocalizations in the provided audio file. Candidates for vocalization are further analyzed and regions identenfied as noise are removed. The VocalMat Identifier outputs a MATLAB formatted file (.MAT) that contains information about identified vocalizations (*e.g.* frequency, vocalization intensity, timestamp).

<p> Vocal Classifier ...


## Features
- __11 Classification Classes:__ VocalMat is able to distinguish between 11 classes of vocalizations
- __Noise Detection:__ eliminate noisy sections that would otherwise be identified as vocalizations
- __Harmonic Detection:__ detect when vocalizations have large steps in frequency
- __Fast Performance:__ optimized versions for personal computers, high-performance computing in clusters, and GPUs

## Getting Started

#### Latest Stable Release
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ahof1704/VocalMat.git
```
#### Directory Structure
- __vocalmat_identifier:__ everything related to the identifier
- __vocalmat_classifier:__ everything related to the identifier
- __audios:__ place the audio files you want to process here
- __outputs:__ all outputs from VocalMat will be placed in this directory
- __.workarea:__ files that are still under development, do not use

## Usage
